HST Exoplanet Plots
---------------------

This repository holds scripts to grab data from the HST Approved Program's list (https://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/approved-programs), obtains targets and instrument/modes, and plots various statistics to understand proposal pressure on exoplanet science on HST.

This was the dream, but it is basically impossible (tried my best in `utils.py`). Decided to manually create a table in the table.txt.
